# Tools and Data for `R` Workshop at INAIR 2018

This repository holds the necessary code and data for Indiana CHE's workshop,
*Reporting with R: It’s Easier Than You Think*, at [INAIR
2018](http://inair.org/inair-conference-2017).

## Check back on Monday, March 19

**This document is currently a DRAFT**, and we encourage you to check back before the conference to make sure that you have the latest version.
We want you to have the best resources possible, so please check back. Right now the things that you can and should do are install R, and Rstudio

## Before you show up

In order to make the best use of our time at the workshop, I would appreciate it if you already had the necessary files, `R`, `RStudio`, and all of the packages that we will be using installed on the computer that you will be bringing with you.

* To easily download the needed files, click on the green "Clone or Download" button, and then click "Download ZIP". Then unzip the file somewhere that you will be able to find it soon.
* To install `R`, visit: [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and download the version for your operating system. Follow the normal installation process.
* To install `Rstudio`, please visit the [RStudio site](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the normal installation process.
* To install the necessary packages: navigate to the folder for this project (that you unzipped earlier), and open `install_packages.R`. This will automatically check for any missing packages that we will be using, and install them as needed. You may see some information scrolling by. Don't worry, you probably don't need it. The script will let you know when it's all done.

Overall, this process should take less than an hour. If you have any questions or difficulties, please reach out to the workshop presenter, [Alex Axthelm](mailto:aaxthelm@che.in.gov).
